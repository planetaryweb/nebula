# nebula_email

This crate is used as an optional dependency for the
[`nebula`](https://crates.io/crates/nebula) crate to implement a handler that
sends emails.

Full documentation will be able to be found on the
[project homepage](https://bluestnight.com/projects/nebula-forms/) once an
initial version is released.
